Steps
 - Make initial conditions equal to final SP of tv_hist
 - Change TDIS for 10 years w/o SS
 - OPTIONAL: change TDIS to have different START_DATE_TIME (I did 2025-01-01t00:00:00; but doesn't matter)
 - Change STO file to have 120 transient steps & no SS
 - Edit all time-series files to repeat final 10 years of historic period
 - OPTIONAL: change the file basename from tv_hist to tv_scenario
